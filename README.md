**Abstract:**   
Oncogenesis results from changes in kinetics or in abundance of proteins in
signal transduction networks. Recently, it was shown that control of
signalling cannot reside in a single gene product, and might well be dispersed
over many components. Which of the reactions in these complex networks are
most important, and how can the existing molecular information be used to
understand why particular genes are oncogenes whereas others are not? We
implement a new method to help address such questions. We apply control
analysis to a detailed kinetic model of the epidermal growth factor-induced
mitogen-activated protein kinase network. We determine the control of each
reaction with respect to three biologically relevant characteristics of the
output of this network: the amplitude, duration and integrated output of the
transient phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). We
confirm that control is distributed, but far from randomly: a small proportion
of reactions substantially control signalling. In particular, the activity of
Raf is in control of all characteristics of the transient profile of ERK
phosphorylation, which may clarify why Raf is an oncogene. Most reactions that
really matter for one signalling characteristic are also important for the
other characteristics. Our analysis also predicts the effects of mutations and
changes in gene expression.
